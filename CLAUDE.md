# User Preferences

## Workflow
- Small PRs: complete one logical phase, commit, then move to the next. Don't batch multiple changes.
- Always work on feature branches, never commit directly to main.
- Run typechecks after code changes.

## Documentation
- Every project uses the .personal/docs/INDEX.md pattern. Consult it before exploring blindly.
- Update docs as part of finishing work, not as a separate step.

## Code Changes
- Prefer running single relevant tests, not the full suite.
- Don't refactor code outside the scope of the current task.
