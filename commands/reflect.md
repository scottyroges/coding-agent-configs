Review this session and extract reusable insights for future development.

Usage:
/reflect                  — review the current session
/reflect "we kept getting tRPC patterns wrong" — focus on a specific friction area

Dispatch this to the reflect agent. It will analyze the session, filter aggressively, and recommend where each insight belongs (CLAUDE.md, docs, skill, hook, or nowhere). It won't make changes — it presents recommendations for your approval.
