Map codebase architecture for a feature, area, or general onboarding.

Usage:
  /codebase-explorer                           — general codebase overview
  /codebase-explorer auth                      — explain how authentication works
  /codebase-explorer "add email notifications" — map what's relevant for a task

Dispatch this to the codebase-explorer agent. This is for understanding architecture and patterns, not for finding specific files (use the built-in Explore for that).
