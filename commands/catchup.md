Show current project state to orient at session start.

Do the following and present a brief summary:

1. Read `.personal/docs/plans/active/` — list any active plans with their current status
2. Run `git status` — show uncommitted changes
3. Run `git log --oneline -5` — show recent commits
4. Run `git branch --show-current` — show what branch you're on
5. Check if there are unstaged changes

Present this as a concise overview (under 15 lines). Don't read the full codebase or load architecture docs — that's what /explore is for.

End with a one-line suggestion: "Looks like you were working on [X]" or "No active work — ready for something new."
